An arduino sketch to water an olive tree

## Using:
  - a DFRobot Analog Waterproof Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor
      see: https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Waterproof_Capacitive_Soil_Moisture_Sensor_SKU_SEN0308
  - a water pump recycled from the water basin of our cat called "Remi" (any pump with own power supply will do fine) 
  - a relay switch that controls that pump
  - 2 push buttons to set the desired moisture level
  - all this (for now) connected on a breadboard
